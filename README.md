# MontrealMischiefMap
Montreal Mischief Map is a project originally developed during the PolyHX 2023 hackathon: https://devpost.com/software/montreal-michief-map
It allows the user to visualize the distribution of crimes through the city for the previous month, and filter them by nature and the moment of the day in which they took place.

# Awards
The project won two awards during the hackathon:
- One of the five main project themes: Security 
- Best data visualization project by DRW 

#Try it out
We are currently aiming to deploy the project on the following domain: "montrealmischiefmap.tech". 
If you want to try it out, you can do so by cloning the project and starting the server and client locally: 
- Server: Run the main.py script in the server directory
- Client: npm start in the client/montrealsafety directory
